# ELEC 390 - WINTER 2023
The final project of ELEC390 in winter 2023 had us develop and deploy a classifier for accelerometer readings of walking vs. jumping.
After installing the requirements file, the main script can be ran to classify accelerometer readings with a trained logistic regression model.
